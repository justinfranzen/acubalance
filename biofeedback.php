        <p>Biofeedback measures various physiological parameters of the body. &nbsp;The information measured with a biofeedback device is then “fed-back” to the client, informing them of the various physiological and stress responses within the body. </p>
        
        <p>The INDIGO Biofeedback system helps manage and retrain stress patterns, educates you on crucial information and empowers you to make lifestyle changes to improve overall health and well-being. &nbsp;Biofeedback has been helpful in reducing the stress from ADHD, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, endocrine imbalances, anxiety and many more conditions that affect so many of us. &nbsp;According to Mayo Clinic website, "Biofeedback training, is used to help treat many physical and mental health issues, including:</p>

        <ul>   
            <li>It's non invasive</li>
            <li>It may reduce or eliminate need for medications</li>

            <h2><strong>How It Works</strong></h2>

                <br>

            <p>We can measure factors of the body such as the voltage from the firing brain cells, the amperage of heart muscle contractions, the voltage of the muscles and the resistance in the flow of electricity of the skin. The same technological theories that brought us biofeedback in the 1960’s, have also brought devices like the CAT Scan, the MRI, TENS, ultra-sound, and many other sophisticated technologies used in our health care systems. Biofeedback utilizes electro-dermal sensors to measure Galvanic Skin Resistance (GSR), also referred to as Electro-Dermal Response (EDR).GSR measures mild electrical impulses on the surface of our skin, which change due to moisture. The moisture of the skin changes according to the body’s degree of stress and/or relaxation.</p>

            <p>There is a direct relationship between sympathetic nervous activity and emotional arousal. GSR is so sensitive it can even measure fluctuations in emotional states. Biofeedback instruments measure muscle activity, skin temperature, electro-dermal activity (sweat gland activity), respiration, heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, brain electrical activity and blood flow.  </p>

        <h2><strong>Biofeedback Sessions</strong></h2>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>During an INDIGO session, the client wears wrist and ankle bracelets and a head harness. The sensors/electrodes comfortably read electrical impulses from the body and send the information to the computer software, which acts as a monitoring device. The biofeedback practitioner is able to educate the client about the specific areas of the body/mind are in need of stress reduction and re-education based on the information translated between the biofeedback device and software to the computer screen. &nbsp;These data findings allow the client to better understand their reactions to stress and learn how to better control their physiological responses.</p>
        
        <p>While the biofeedback process is completely non-invasive and gentle, this powerful stress management support system allows relaxation and increases the bodies ability to heal itself as it is designed to do. The process of biofeedback helps the body remember the balanced and stress free state. When entrained to the healthier patterns of a relaxed state, this process of self-regeneration often happens naturally. </p>
