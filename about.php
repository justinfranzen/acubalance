        <p>Here at AcuBalance, our core belief is BALANCE. We look at the whole person; the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual elements of the body. The mind body connection is vital to our health. The first step in reducing stress and achieving balance is tuning into what the stressors are in our lives. National Institute of health adds Chronic Stress may shorten life expectancy up to 20 years. Continuous Stress can weaken the immune system causing the body to be vulnerable to diseases. Stress can cause the telomeres of our DNA to shorten which can lead to our cells aging faster, lower cellular frequency and can cause disruption in our DNA replication process. When the frequency of our cells is high, we experience good health; when the frequency is low, we are more susceptible to disease. Disease is found in non-vibrating, non-charged, or non-energized cells. </p>

        <blockquote>Be awakened to the connection between the healthy mind, spirit and body. "I believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone, best both for the body and the mind." - Albert Einstein</blockquote>
