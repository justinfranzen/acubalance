            <h2><strong>Did you know stress is one of the leading causes of disease?</strong></h2>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>According to U.S. Centers for Disease Control up to 90% of doctors visits are stress related. Many people think of stress only in terms of things like deadlines at work, family or relationship stress, financial pressures, traffic jams, or the death of a loved one perhaps. However, stress reactions also occur on the unconscious, cellular, subtle or energetic levels each time we are exposed to a toxin, pathogen, allergen and every time our body experiences a nutritional deficiency or excess. </p>
